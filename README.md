# Model Comparisson Project

This project aims to predict the quality of wine, by the application of Neural Networks. To do so, it was necessary to include some data cleaning techniques, data pre-processing and feature engineering. To bring a good global structure of the project, the NVP techniques was brought up.
This project took direction to a binary classifier, being wine classified as good or bad. The library used was keras and tensorflow, since it is very user friendly. 
The best accuracy reached was from 82%. To achieve so, it was needed to normalize the data, resample, build new columns, and tune the hyperparameters of the model. A crucial aspect in my project was realizing that the balance of the separation of the classes had to be corrected to avoid too much similarity of the wine parameters from the same class.
